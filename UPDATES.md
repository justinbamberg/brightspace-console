# Changes as of June 10, 2024

1. Removed API input and output boxes, our Admin's don't need or know how to use this, I do API commands in Postman.
2. Add Grade and Grades<br>
   a. Grade pulls a current released grade for one user to one course.
   b. Grades pulls a list of all released grades from all courses the user is enrolled in.
3. Add an export to .csv button which grabs the command line and the results.
4. Get list of roles
5. working ---- create user
6. working ---- create course
